# ChatBuddy
ChatBuddy is an interactive chatbot built using Python and Tkinter. It leverages the NLTK library to understand and respond to user inputs. Unlike traditional chatbots, ChatBuddy has a unique feature that allows it to learn new responses directly from users, enhancing its conversational abilities over time.
