# ChatBuddy
ChatBuddy is an interactive chatbot built using Python and Tkinter by Prashant Kumar. It leverages the NLTK library to understand and respond to user inputs. Unlike traditional chatbots, ChatBuddy has a unique feature that allows it to learn new responses directly from users, enhancing its conversational abilities over time.

Features:

* Interactive GUI: Developed with Tkinter, providing a user-friendly interface. 

* Learning Capability: ChatBuddy can learn new responses when it encounters unfamiliar inputs.

* Customizable Responses: Easily update or add new response pairs to improve interaction quality.

* Chat History: Maintains a history of the conversation, which can be saved and loaded.

* User-Friendly Design: Includes warning messages for empty inputs and confirmation prompts for saving new responses.

Usage:

* Start Chatting: Type your message and press Enter or click the "Send" button.

* Teach New Responses: When ChatBuddy encounters an unknown input, it will prompt you to provide a suitable response.

* Quit: Type 'quit' to close the application.

Project Structure:

* chatbuddy.py: Main script to run the chatbot.

* user_responses.json: Stores learned responses.

* chat_history.txt: Stores chat history.

Future Enhancements:

* Integrate more sophisticated NLP techniques for better understanding and responses.

* Add support for multiple languages.

* Implement a database to manage learned responses and chat history more efficiently.
